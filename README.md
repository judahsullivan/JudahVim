# My Neovim config "Judah Vim"

**IMPORTANT: If you are planning to use my neovim config please note**

This is config that primarily fit my style for coding needs, and may not work for everyone. I wouldn't just blindly use them. Proceed at your own risk!

## Installation of my config

** First you want to Back up your current config!**

```
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}

mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}

```

** Now lets clone the repository **

```
git clone https://github.com/judahsullivan/JudahVim ~/.config/nvim

```
